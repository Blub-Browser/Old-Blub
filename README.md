# Blub
Blub is a Chromium based web browser made using Electron JS. 

Some parts of the source code in this project come from min (https://github.com/minbrowser/min), though we are actively making changes and editing all source code. 

# Repository Information 
"Nightly" is the main branch of this repository. All active development happens in Nightly, and new beta releases happen often. 
Because of this, nightly builds will be incomplete and have bugs. 

Please make sure all contributions are somewhat "working" when you create a pull request, and will not break other parts of the code when merged. 

As development continues, changes are pushed into beta and release branches. If a bug is found after release (in the release branch), bug fix changes will be made directly there.
